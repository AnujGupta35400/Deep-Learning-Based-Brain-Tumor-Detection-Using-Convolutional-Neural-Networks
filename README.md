# Brain Tumor Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect brain tumors in MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging transfer learning with the ResNet101v2 model, the system classifies brain MRI images into two categories: tumor and non-tumor. Preprocessing techniques such as histogram equalization, morphological opening, and data augmentation were applied to improve model accuracy and generalization.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Utilizes pre-trained ResNet101v2 for transfer learning to classify brain tumor images.
- **Preprocessing Techniques:** Includes histogram equalization and morphological opening to enhance image features.
- **Data Augmentation:** Applied to expand training data and improve model robustness.
- **Model Performance:** High accuracy achieved in classifying brain tumors and non-tumor images.
